# JustForShow - 0.2
Under construction

## Browser support
The IntersectionObserver API is relatively new. Despite that it's supported by all major browser, except for IE.

At the moment this package doesn't natively include a polyfill, but if you want this package to work everywhere, I would recommend to install [this intersection observer polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/intersection-observer) and import it before importing JustForShow.
